----General Thoughts & methodology----

Designing code architecture & UML
	I prefer to create quick simple sketches over full UML Diagrams.
	You can spend a lot of time making a great initial design but a lot of the time, the finished product doesn't resemble the initial design that much.
	Faster iteration is in my opinion better and you're less lickely to get attached to your initial design.
	If a full UML is necessary, I prefer to write it closer to the end when the design should be pretty stable.
